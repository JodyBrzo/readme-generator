# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator

 ![mit](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD-brightgreen)

## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.
You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.
Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Review the Good README Guide as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.
The application will be invoked by using the following command:
node index.js
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

## Installation
To install-----Here are some guidelines to help you get started:


Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.


Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

## Usage
To USE me ---  Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.


Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.
